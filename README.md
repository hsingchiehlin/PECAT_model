# PECAT model
This repository is constructed for the paper "Development of Physiological-based Gut Absorption Model to Improve Modeling of Bioavailability for Environmental Chemicals" and contains scripts and data for executing the PECAT model. "PECAT_model_exe_code.rmd" is the main script to reproduce results in the main manuscript (Figs. 3 - 5) and supplementary figures (Figs.S7 - S9). "Supplementary_code.rmd" is the script to reproduce results in the Supplementary materials Sections 2 - 3 (Figs.S1 - S6).
